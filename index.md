My Profile: I am currently studying for a Master's degree at the University of Sheffield, where I am specializing in Data Science. I am able to master a variety of programming languages, including python, R, and SPSS, to effectively analyze data and create visualizations. I am interested and challenged by machine learning and data mining, and hope to have more to learn afterwardÔºÅ

Course: INF6027 Introduction to Data Science

Project: Select a dataset on which to use at least one type of data analysis, containing at least two visualizations that provide a reasoned discussion of motivation, research context, methodology and experimental design, results, and discussion.

Brief Introduction: Based on IMDb movie data, this study analyzes the relationship between movie genres and running time by combining K-Means clustering, ridge regression and random forest models. It is found that sci-fi and action movies have the longest running time, while comedy and short films are shorter; running time is significantly correlated with genre characteristics. The clustering and classification results are highly accurate and provide support for movie production, marketing and recommendation systems. The study suggests optimizing the runtime for different genres, such as short films for streaming and long-time sci-fi films for theatrical release. In the future, box office and audience data can be combined to further explore movie industry trends and audience preferences.

Research Question: How does the distribution of movie genres affect the clustering of movies? What are the trends in the number and genre distribution of movies in different years? Can classification models accurately predict the genre or cluster to which a movie belongs?
